            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>You know who I am. (We’ve spoken of the Net, which can be defined as the totality of 
                all information andcommunication transfer. Some of these transfers are privileged and 
                limited to various
                elites, which gives the Net a hierarchic aspect. Other transactions are open to all--so 
                theNet has a horizontal or non-hierarchic aspect as well. Military and Intelligence 
                data arerestricted, as are banking and currency information and the like. 
                But for the most part the telephone, the postal system, public data banks, etc. 
                are accessible to everyone andanyone. Thus within the Net there has begun 
                to emerge a shadowy sort of counter-Net, which we will call the Web 
                (as if the Net were a fishing-net and the Web were spiderwebswoven through 
                the interstices and broken sections of the Net). Generally we’ll use the term 
                Web to refer to the alternate horizontal open structure of info- exchange, 
                thenon-hierarchic network, and reserve the term counter-Net to indicate 
                clandestine illegaland rebellious use of the Web, including actual data-piracy 
                and other forms of leechingoff the Net itself. Net, Web, and counter-Net are 
                all parts of the same whole patterncomplex--they blur into each other at innumerable 
                points. The terms are not meant to define areas but to suggest tendencies)
